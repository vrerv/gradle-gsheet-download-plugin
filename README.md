A Gradle Plugin to download Google Sheets as CSV files.

* You can download multiple sheets at once so that you can include some data in your build process.

## How to use

### Create Google Service Account

* You have to set up a google service account and create application credential key in Google Cloud Console.
* Then, you have to share the Google Sheet with the service account email.
* You can set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to the path of your application credential file.
  Otherwise, you can set the path in the plugin configuration.

For more details about Google Sheets API, see [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api).
